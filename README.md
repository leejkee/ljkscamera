# ljkscamera
My photoelectric engineering training, we conctrl the rasberrypi camera to record a video or take a picture by a script using python3.



Before running it,you must install the `OpenCV3(or you see the cv2, C++API)`, which you can download it by **pip**.
Then, you must add the camera's function in this.
For example, `camera.start_recording()` means that you will record a video by your camera,and the video will be saved in the path writing in bracket.

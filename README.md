# ljkscamera
My photoelectric engineering training, we conctrol the rasberrypi camera to record a video and take a picture by python3.



Before running it,you must install the `OpenCV3(or you see the cv2, C++API)`, which you can download it by **pip**.
Then, you must add the camera's functions in your codes.
For example, `camera.start_recording()` means that you will record a video by your camera,and the video will be saved in the path writing in bracket.

capture pictures:`record_picture.py`

record videos:`record_video.py`

control the camera by keyboard:`waitKeyDemo_1_.py`

extract frames:`imageCapture_demo1.py`
